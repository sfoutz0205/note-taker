# Note-Taker #

Note-Taker an application that allows you to write and save notes with a title and plain text description, and delete notes as they become irrelevant.

## Creation ## 

### Created  Using ###
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
  - Node.js
    - Express.js

This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. It was my responsibility to build this back end and connect it to a pre-existing front end.
